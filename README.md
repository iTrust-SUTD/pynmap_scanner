## Usage
* Add some text here
   ```
   When running the code, it will ask you for a network/device to scan. Input the IP address of the device/network(e.g.127.0.0.1). After that choose from Ping, scan os, scan ports or all. Choose the option you want. After a while it should say that the output is in a file with the time you inputted the options. For example at 12:42 pm on 13 March 2020, I chose to scan os of 127.0.0.1, the file name should be OS_2020-03-13 1242.txt.
